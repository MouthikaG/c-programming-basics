# C Programming Basics

This repository contains a collection of simple C programs written to practice
and strengthen core programming concepts.

The programs are intentionally small and focused. Each file demonstrates
one basic idea in C programming, making this repository useful for revision,
practice, and foundational learning.

## 📌 What This Repository Contains
- Basic C programs such as:
  - Constants
  - Fibonacci series
  - Number operations
  - Simple logic-based programs
  - Beginner-level problem solving
- Each program is written as a separate `.c` file
- Files are organized in alphabetical order for easy navigation

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository represents my learning journey in C programming.
It focuses on clarity, correctness, and understanding fundamentals
rather than complex implementations.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Programs
1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (GCC recommended)
2. Open a terminal in the project directory
3. Compile a program using:
   gcc filename.c -o output
4. Run the program using:
   ./output

Example:
   gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci
   ./fibonacci

## 🧠 Learning Focus
- Syntax and structure of C
- Logical thinking and problem solving
- Use of loops, conditions, and functions
- Writing clean and readable code

## 🔄 Future Updates
- More programs will be added gradually
- Short descriptions may be added to individual files
- Programs may be grouped into folders when expanded
